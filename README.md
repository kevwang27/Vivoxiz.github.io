==============

*By Ivan Sobonja, Matthew Gregory, Joseph Kenton, and Kevin Wang*  

##### Genre

This game can be classified as an action and racing game.

##### The Story of the Inverted Rider 

*Once upon a time, there was an English man. He travelled to America, hoping to have a good time driving on the left side of the road. What he didn't know, though, was that America was different than the UK, and that HE WAS BREAKING THE LAW.*

##### Object of the Game

The main goal of the game is to avoid oncoming traffic.

There are two different possible objectives in the game, as there are two different modes. In one mode, you need to survive for a certain distance to reach an end, which is a roadblock created by police, without crashing and losing all three lives. 

The other mode is an endless mode, where you try to survive for the longest distance you can without losing all of your lives.

##### Game Assets

This game will require a number of road images to create the illusion of a moving road, which will be created in Photoshop. Many different types of car images will also be needed, which are gotten from the link below.
